# What is required from an open source steward for evidence showing compliance with vulnerability reporting?

Open-source software stewards must document their cybersecurity policy in a verifiable manner, as described in [[stewards/demonstrate]]. For evidence specifically related to vulnerability reporting compliance, stewards should be prepared to demonstrate how their policy fosters voluntary reporting of vulnerabilities by developers, as required under [[Article 24]].

Market surveillance authorities, potentially in cooperation with the relevant CSIRTs, may have more specific requirements for what evidence they expect. The exact requirements may vary depending on which authority has jurisdiction, as Member States designate their own market surveillance authorities for this purpose ([[Article 52(2)]]).

Identifying the relevant CSIRT for a given steward remains an open question pending further clarification (see [[pending-guidance/csirt-identification]]). Until this is resolved, stewards should focus on maintaining clear, verifiable documentation of their vulnerability handling processes and be prepared to provide this documentation to authorities upon request, in a language that authority can easily understand ([[Article 24(2)]]).
