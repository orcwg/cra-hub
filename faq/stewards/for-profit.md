# Can a company be classified as an open-source software steward?

Yes, a company can be classified as an open-source software steward. The CRA defines a steward as _"a legal person, other than a manufacturer"_ that systematically provides sustained support for the development of free and open-source software intended for commercial activities ([[Article 3(14)]]). [[Recital 19]] provides additional context: _"Open-source software stewards include certain foundations as well as entities that develop and publish free and open-source software in a business context, **including not-for-profit entities.**"_

A company can even be a steward for a project that also has a commercial version. In this scenario, the company would be a **manufacturer** for the paid or monetised version (with corresponding manufacturer obligations), while simultaneously being a **steward** for the free or "community" version that it publishes but does not monetise.

This dual role is possible because the CRA assesses each product separately:

- **Manufacturer obligations** apply to the monetised version and flow to organisations that have purchased it or are the source of monetisation.
- **Steward obligations** apply to the non-monetised open source version and focus on fostering secure development and effective vulnerability handling for users of that version.
