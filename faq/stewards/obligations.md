# What are the obligations of _open-source software stewards_?

_Open-source software stewards_ are subject to a "light-touch and tailor-made regulatory regime" ([[Recital 19]]), defined in [[Article 24]]. This regime includes the following:

* Maintaining a cybersecurity policy.
* Maintaining a vulnerability management policy.
* Cooperating with Market Surveillance Authorities when needed.
* Notifiying the [relevant CSIRT][] and [ENISA][], and informing users of actively exploited vulnerabilities and severe incidents in certain circumstances. More detailed information in [[stewards/notification-obligations]]

[relevant CSIRT]: ../vulnerability-handling/csirt.md
[ENISA]: ../vulnerability-handling/enisa.md
