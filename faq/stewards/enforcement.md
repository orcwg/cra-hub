# What should open-source software stewards expect in terms of enforcement style and corrective actions from market surveillance authorities?

Open-source software stewards should expect engagement focused on governance and ecosystem risk, not punishment for individual defects.

Market surveillance authorities are likely to see stewards as system coordinators and will expect them to play a role where their actions materially influence security outcomes across many projects. Enforcement will emphasize processes and accountability—such as vulnerability handling, release practices, and coordination mechanisms—rather than the software itself.

Under [[Article 52(3)]], when a market surveillance authority finds that a steward does not comply with its obligations under [[Article 24]], it _"shall require the open-source software steward to ensure that all appropriate corrective actions are taken."_ Corrective actions are likely to involve clarifying roles, improving baseline practices, and publishing or following clear policies.

Stewards also benefit from explicit protection against administrative fines. [[Article 64(10)(b)]] provides that administrative fines _"shall not apply to [...] any infringement of this Regulation by open-source software stewards."_ Sanctions would be unlikely unless a steward controls critical infrastructure and persistently ignores known, systemic risks—and even then, the available remedy would be corrective action rather than financial penalties.

For more details on steward obligations and the consequences of non-compliance, see [[stewards/obligations]] and [[stewards/penalties]].
