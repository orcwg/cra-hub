# What technical documentation is expected from an open source steward?

Open-source software stewards are not required to produce the technical documentation that manufacturers must prepare under [[Article 31]]. Their obligations are limited to putting in place and documenting a cybersecurity policy as described in [[Article 24]].

However, stewards may voluntarily choose to provide additional documentation as part of a security attestation program to support manufacturers exercising due diligence when integrating the steward's software into their products.

For more details on steward obligations, see [[stewards/obligations]]. For information on security attestations, see [[attestations/what-is-a-security-attestation]].
