# What's the difference between a manufacturer and a steward in the context of open source?

A manufacturer and an open-source software steward are completely different roles under the CRA, with distinct origins and purposes.

**Manufacturer** is a role established in the New Legislative Framework (NLF) and the Blue Guide. In the context of the CRA, it applies to any natural or legal person who develops or manufactures products with digital elements and markets them under their name or trademark—whether for payment, monetisation, or free of charge (see [[Article 3(13)]]). The key factor is engaging in commercial activity by placing products on the market.

**Open-source software steward** is a new role created specifically for the CRA to accommodate the unique nature of open source development. As defined in [[Article 3(14)]], a steward is a _"legal person, other than a manufacturer"_, that systematically provides sustained support for free and open-source software intended for commercial activities and ensures its viability. This role recognises organisations that support open source outside of direct monetisation—such as foundations or entities that publish free and open-source software in a business context without placing it on the market themselves (see [[Recital 19]]).

The steward role exists because many important open source projects are published but not "made available on the market" in the CRA's legal sense. Without this category, the organisations supporting such projects would fall outside the CRA entirely. The steward obligations are deliberately "light-touch and tailor-made" compared to manufacturer obligations, reflecting that stewards do not directly monetise the software they support.
