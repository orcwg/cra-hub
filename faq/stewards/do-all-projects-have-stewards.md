# Do all open source projects have an _open-source software steward_?

No. Most open source projects will not have a steward. 

A steward must be a "legal person" ([[Article 3(14)]]), such as a company, and most open source projects are not supported by a company. 

The stewarding organization must also have "the purpose or objective of systematically providing support on a sustained basis" ([[Article 3(14)]]) and their software must be "ultimately intended for commercial activities" ([[Recital 19]]). Organizations who do not meet those tests will also not be considered stewards.
