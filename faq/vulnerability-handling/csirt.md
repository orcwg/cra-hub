# What is a _CSIRT_?

CSIRT stands for Computer Security Incident Response Team.

In Europe, there are multiple national CSIRTs which are part of the [European Union CSIRTs network][].

But [Article 12(1) of the NIS 2 Directive][] states that each European country must designate a _single_ CSIRT to manage coordinated vulnerability disclosures.

In the context of the CRA, that CSIRT is the relevant CISRT that is referenced throughtout the text and defined as the _CSIRT designated as coordinator_ in [[Article 3(51)]]. 

If you are headquartered in Europe, you can easily find the relevant CISRT on the [member section of the network's website][network members].

If you are not headquartered in Europe, [[Article 17(4)]] explains the criteria _manufacturers_ should use to identify the relevant CSIRT.
