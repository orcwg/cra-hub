# What criteria determine whether an open source project is in scope of the CRA?

> [!WARNING]  
> This FAQ needs refactoring.

The CRA regulates _natural and legal persons_ (either an individual or an organisation that has a legal personality, like a business, foundation or charity). There are three possible categories with descending requirements. These categories are _manufacturer_, _Open Source Software Steward_, or _Out of Scope_.

> Note: At present, we believe that a natural person (an individual) cannot be considered an Open Source Software Steward, however we are currently verifying this with the European Commission. We will provide more detailed guidance as soon as possible.

- You are **out of scope** of the CRA (meaning you are not required to comply with the regulation), if you are a natural person (an individual), and:
  - you are not monetising your project at all, or
  - you are monetising your project, without the intention of making a profit. (See Question: What does "Monetizing without making a profit" mean?)

> Note: Further information for legal persons (organisations, foundations, associations) will be provided here as soon as we receive further clarifications and information from the European Commission.
