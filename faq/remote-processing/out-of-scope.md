# What is not considered remote data processing?

The following are **not** considered remote data processing:

- Remote processing of data that isn't fed back into the product (such as telemetry data).
- Websites that do not support the function of the product (by contrast with websites that support a function, such as providing an authentication page).
- Data processing that supports the manufacturer’s own operations (such as payroll systems, customer relationship management, or other administrative systems).
