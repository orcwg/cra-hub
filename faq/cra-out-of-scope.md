# What is NOT in scope of the CRA?

The following are NOT in scope of the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA):

- Services
- Products that do not contain software
- Products already covered by other regulations or directives: civil aviation equipment (already covered by [2018/1139][]), marine equipment (already covered by [2014/90][]), medical devices (already covered by [2017/745][] and [2017/746][]), motor vehicles (already covered by [2019/2144][]), and software as a service (SaaS) (already covered by [NIS 2][])
- Products exclusively designed for national security or defence purposes
- Products specifically designed to process classified information

_It is worth noting however, that the intent of the EU legislators is to harmonize the various regulations mentioned above with the CRA in the near future._
