# What kinds of products are regulated by the CRA?

The following types of products are regulated by the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA):

- Hardware products that contain software (e.g. laptops, smart appliances, mobile phones, network equipment, CPUs, etc.)
- Software products (e.g. operating systems, word processing, games or mobile apps, software libraries, etc.)
- Remote data processing solutions for any of the above, as far as those solutions are necessary for a product to perform its functions (e.g. cloud-based services that allow control of a smart lock at a distance, remote database that backs-up user preferences, etc.)
