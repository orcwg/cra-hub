# Open source guidance

As described in [[Article 9]], the CRA Expert Group (see [[cra-itself/cra-expert-group]]) is consulted by the European Commission as it prepares guidance. As part of this process, the CRA Expert Group has had access to draft versions of this guidance on open source and has been able to provide comments and feedback.

FAQs that reference this document contain sections that rely on a conservative interpretation of this draft guidance on open source. It's worth noting that this guidance might still change before publication. These sections will be reviewed and updated once the official guidance is published.
