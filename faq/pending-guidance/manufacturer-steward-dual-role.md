# Manufacturer and steward dual role clarification

## Guidance needed

Confirmation that _manufacturers_ of commercial open source software can be the _open-source software steward_ of the community edition of the same open source project.

## Background

Some companies maintain both commercial and community editions of the same open source software. The relationship between manufacturer and steward roles in this context needs clarification.

## Why this matters

This clarification is important for commercial open source companies because it directly impacts a very common business model: releasing a community edition of a project as open source, and providing a hardened, entreprise version of the same project with long term support for a fee.

## Impact on FAQs

This guidance specifically affects the FAQ about whether manufacturers can also serve as open-source software stewards.
