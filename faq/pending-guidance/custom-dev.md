## Guidance needed

Confirmation that custom development of software isn't in scope of the CRA as there is no product placed on the market.

## Guidance received

Custom development of software is in scope of the CRA. However, as explained in [[official/faq_4-2-5]], manufacturers may deviate from two essential requirements (namely, secure by default configuration in point (2.b) of [[Annex I, Part I]] and providing security updates to users free of charge in point (8) of [[Annex I, Part II]]) in relation to tailor-made products that are fitted to a particular purpose for a particular business user and where both the manufacturer and the user have explicitly agreed to a different set of contractual terms.
