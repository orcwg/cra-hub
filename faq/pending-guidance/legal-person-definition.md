# Legal person definition clarification

## Guidance needed

Confirmation that _legal persons_ do not include _natural persons_ in the context of the CRA.

## Background

[Article 3(14)][] states that an _open-source software steward_ must be a _legal person_. The term "legal person" has different meanings depending on context and jurisdiction, including within the EU itself.

## Why this matters

This distinction is crucial for determining:
- Whether solo maintainers can be considered _open-source software stewards_
- Whether loosely organized groups of maintainers can collectively be considered stewards

## Impact on FAQs

This guidance affects multiple FAQ answers about who can be considered an open-source software steward under the CRA.
