# Can a _manufacturer_ also be an _open-source software steward_?

Yes, a _manufacturer_ can also be an _open-source software steward_.

This can happen whenever a _manufacturer_ releases open source software and meets the requirements to be the  _open-source software steward_ of that project.

A _manufacturer_ of commercial open source software can even be the _open-source software steward_ of the community edition of the same project that it commercializes. In such a case, it has _manufacturer_ obligations to its customers and _steward_ obligations to the users of its community edition.
