# What should small and medium manufacturers expect in terms of enforcement style and corrective actions from market surveillance authorities?

Small and medium manufacturers should expect proportionate, step-by-step enforcement focused on bringing products into compliance rather than imposing immediate penalties. Market surveillance authorities typically scale expectations to risk and capacity, not to formal legal obligations alone.

Authorities are required to carry out their activities _"taking due account of the size of undertakings, in particular as regards microenterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises"_ ([[Article 47]]). When determining fines, authorities must consider _"whether the manufacturer is a microenterprise or a small or medium-sized enterprise, including a start-up"_ ([[Recital 120]]).

Based on patterns seen under GDPR enforcement, authorities will usually begin with guidance, warnings, or requests for corrective action before considering penalties. Common corrective actions include patching vulnerabilities, improving update mechanisms, or fixing insecure default configurations. Penalties or market restrictions are more likely only if a manufacturer fails to act, repeats issues, or puts users at significant risk.

Smaller entities also benefit from explicit legal safeguards: all penalties must be _"effective, proportionate and dissuasive"_ ([[Recital 120]]), and penalties imposed on natural persons must account for _"the economic situation"_ and _"size"_ of the entity ([[Recital 121]]). Microenterprises and small enterprises are explicitly exempted from fines for failing to meet the 24-hour early warning deadline for vulnerability and incident notifications ([[Recital 120]]).
