# Is a company considered a manufacturer if it funds the development and maintenance of an open source project through a steward?

No. How a product is developed or financed does not determine manufacturer status under the CRA.

The key factor is whether the company **markets the product under their own name or trademark**. Simply funding development or maintenance of an open source project through a steward does not make the funder a manufacturer ([[Recital 18]]).

A company becomes a manufacturer only when it places a product on the market; meaning it supplies the product for distribution or use in the course of a commercial activity under its own name or trademark, whether for payment or free of charge ([[Article 3(13)]]).
