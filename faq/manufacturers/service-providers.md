# Can companies that invoice a steward for development work on a project be considered manufacturers?

No. Companies that invoice a steward for development work are service providers, not manufacturers under the CRA.

The CRA applies to products being placed on the market, not to development services. A manufacturer is defined as a person who develops or manufactures products with digital elements and _"markets them under its name or trademark"_ ([[Article 3(14)]]). A company providing contracted development services to a steward is not marketing the product under its own name; the steward or another entity is.

This distinction holds regardless of the client's status. Whether the client is an open-source software steward, a manufacturer, or another type of organization, the service provider relationship does not make the contractor a manufacturer. The determining factor is who places the product on the market under their name or trademark, not who performs the development work.
