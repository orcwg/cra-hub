# As a _manufacturer_, if I make a mistake or a security flaw is found in my project, will I get in trouble?

- If you fail to comply with the CRA, you will likely receive a letter or email from Market Surveillance Authorities asking you to address the issue.
- If you continue to fail to address the issue as a manufacturer, you could receive a fine. The fine will be proportional to the size of your organisation and how severely you broke the law.
- [Microenterprises or small enterprises][SME] are exempted from fines relating to the obligation to notify authorities about vulnerabilities and severe incidents within 24 hours.
