# Can I get paid to develop an open source project without being considered a manufacturer?

Yes, you can get paid to develop an open source project without being considered a manufacturer under the CRA.

The CRA distinguishes between being paid *for* the software (monetisation) and being paid *to work on* the software (development funding). Receiving payment to develop or maintain an open source project does not, by itself, make you a manufacturer. As [[Recital 18]] clarifies, _"the mere circumstances under which the product with digital elements has been developed, or how the development has been financed, should therefore not be taken into account when determining the commercial or non-commercial nature of that activity."_

This means that various common funding arrangements do not trigger manufacturer status:

- **Employment or contracting**: Being hired or contracted to work on an open source project does not make you a manufacturer—your employer or client may have obligations, but you as a paid developer do not.
- **Grants and sponsorships**: Receiving grants, sponsorships, or foundation funding to support development work does not constitute monetisation of the software itself.
- **Donations for living expenses**: A natural person receiving donations that cover reasonable living expenses and development costs is not considered to be monetising the project.

What *does* make someone a manufacturer is monetising the software itself—for example, by charging for access to the software, selling paid support services that exceed cost recovery, or using the software as a platform to monetise other services.

For more information on what constitutes monetisation, see [[maintainers/monetization]]. For details on how contributions affect CRA status, see [[maintainers/contributors]].
