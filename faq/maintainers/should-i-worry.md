# I am worried about how the CRA might impact me, and so I am considering shutting down my open source projects. Should I do that?

The CRA should have zero or minimal impact on most open source developers, so you should probably not shut down your open source projects because of the CRA. There are several reasons for this:

First, the CRA likely does not apply to you. 

- If you're just a contributor, the CRA explicitly exempts you. For more detail, see [[maintainers/contributors]]
- If you're a maintainer, and you _do not_ "monetise" your FOSS codebase, the CRA explicitly exempts you. For more detail, see [[maintainers/no-monetization]]
- If you're a maintainer, and you _do_ monetise your FOSS codebase, you may still be exempted, depending on exactly how you are monetizing the codebase and your participation in it. For more detail, see [[maintainers/monetization]]

Second, even if the CRA does ultimately apply to you, penalties for solo and small-team maintainers are unlikely to be severe. For more detail, see [[maintainers/penalties]]

As a result, we would strongly urge you _not_ to shut down any open source projects (or your participation in those projects) just because of the CRA.
