# Can a loosely organized group of maintainers be considered to be an _open-source software steward_?

No. As defined in [Article 3(14)][], an _open-source software steward_ must be a _legal person_, which in the context of the CRA means a legal entity such as a business or nonprofit.

> [!CAUTION]
> Pending confirmation through European Commission Guidance that _legal persons_ do not include _natural persons_ in the context of the CRA.
