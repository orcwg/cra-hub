# Am I subject to the CRA if I earn a living from the open source project I maintain?

No. If your revenue only covers your actual costs—including a reasonable salary or [living expenses][]—then you are not considered to be monetising the project, and you would not be subject to the CRA on that basis. See [[cra-itself/actual-costs]] for more details on what counts as actual costs.

However, if you are making a profit (revenue exceeding your costs), this likely indicates you are monetising the project. See [[cra-itself/monetisation]] for what constitutes monetisation under the CRA. In that case, you would be considered a manufacturer for the software you monetise, with corresponding obligations under [[Article 13]].

Even in the monetisation scenario, your manufacturer obligations apply only to the monetised version. For example, if you offer both a paid "enterprise" version and a free "community" version, you would be a manufacturer only for the enterprise version. The community version would remain outside the CRA's scope provided you are an indivual and not an organization (see [[maintainers/solo-maintainer-steward]] for more on this distinction).
