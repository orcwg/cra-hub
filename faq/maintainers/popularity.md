# Does the mere popularity of my open source project expose me to CRA regulation?

No — the mere popularity of your open source project does not expose you to CRA regulation.

The CRA does not use popularity, user count, or widespread adoption as criteria for determining whether a project falls within scope. What matters is whether the software is supplied _in the course of a commercial activity_ — meaning whether it is monetised or placed on the market under circumstances that indicate commercial intent.

As [[Recital 18]] clarifies, _"the provision of products with digital elements qualifying as free and open-source software that are not monetised by their manufacturers should not be considered to be a commercial activity."_ This means you can have millions of users, including in enterprise or critical infrastructure environments, without triggering CRA obligations, as long as you are not monetising the project.

While popularity itself creates no legal obligations, it may:

- Increase visibility to downstream users or market surveillance authorities
- Lead to requests from companies seeking help with their own compliance efforts
- Create demand for [security attestations](../attestations/what-are-attestations.md) for your project

None of these change your legal status under the CRA unless you begin monetising or otherwise supplying the software in a commercial context.

For more details on what determines whether an open source project is in scope, see [[projects/scope]]. For information on what constitutes monetisation, see [[maintainers/no-monetization]] and [[maintainers/monetization]].
