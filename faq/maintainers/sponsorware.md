# How is 'sponsorware' affected by the CRA?

Sponsorware is a model where sponsors receive early access to software that is later released as open source. Under the CRA, the regulatory treatment depends on which phase of the sponsorware model is being considered.

**During the exclusive sponsor phase**, when only paying sponsors can access the software, this arrangement functions as custom development or a paid service rather than a product being placed on the market. The software is essentially being provided to specific clients in exchange for payment, which means the general public cannot access it. This phase is typically outside the scope of the CRA as there is no product placed on the EU market, just custom development.

**Once the software is released as open source**, it is treated like any other open source software under the CRA. At that point, the standard criteria for determining whether open source software is in scope apply—primarily whether the person publishing it is monetising it through that release. See [[maintainers/monetization]] for details on how monetisation affects CRA obligations.

In practice, the sponsorware model means the initial sponsors are essentially funding the development of software that will later become freely available. The payment is for early access and supporting development, rather than for a product being placed on the EU market. This aligns with [[Recital 18]], which clarifies that _"the mere circumstances under which the product with digital elements has been developed, or how the development has been financed, should therefore not be taken into account when determining the commercial or non-commercial nature of that activity."_
