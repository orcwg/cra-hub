# Does providing technical support for a fee put you in scope of the CRA?

Providing technical support for a fee may or may not put you in scope of the CRA, depending on your relationship to the open source project.

**If you are the publisher of the project:** Charging for technical support services that are closely associated with the supply of the software can constitute monetisation, which would make the software a product placed on the market. However, this only applies where the price charged _"does not serve only the recuperation of actual costs"_ ([[Recital 15]]). If you're a natural person and the fees only cover costs related to design, development, and maintenance—including reasonable living expenses—this alone would not make you a manufacturer. If you're a legal person that meets the definition of open-source software steward, you would be subject to steward obligations rather than manufacturer obligations for the non-monetised version of the software.

**If you are a not-for-profit organisation:** There is additional flexibility. If your organisation is set up to ensure that all earnings after costs are reinvested in not-for-profit objectives, your activities are not considered commercial even if you charge for support services ([[Recital 18]]).

**If you are not the publisher:** You are simply a service provider, and services are not products with digital elements under the CRA. For example, if you help a customer install open source software on their server but don't distribute the software yourself, you are not placing any product on the market and are therefore not in scope.
