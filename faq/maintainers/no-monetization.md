# Am I subject to the CRA if I maintain, but do not monetize, an open source project?

If you are the maintainer of an open source codebase, and you do not monetize it, then the CRA _does not_ apply to you.

The CRA applies
> only in relation to products […] supplied […] in the course of a _commercial activity_
([Recital 15][], emphasis added)

And it states that

> the provision of […] free and open source software that are not monetized by their manufacturers _should not be considered to be a commercial activity_
([Recital 18][], emphasis added)
