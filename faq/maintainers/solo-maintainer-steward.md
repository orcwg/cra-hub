# Can a solo maintainer be considered to be an _open-source software steward_?

No. As defined in [Article 3(14)][], an _open-source software steward_ must be a _legal person_ (e.g. a company, an organization, etc.) in contrast with a _natural person_ (i.e. a human being). The obligations of _open-source software stewards_ described in [Article 24][] therefore do not apply to solo maintainers. It is worth noting however, that _natural persons_ are subject to the same obligations as _legal persons_ would be should they monetize their poject.

> [!CAUTION]
> Pending confirmation through European Commission Guidance that _legal persons_ do not include _natural persons_ in the context of the CRA.
