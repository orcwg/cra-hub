# Can a solo maintainer be considered to be an _open-source software steward_?

No. As defined in [[Article 3(14)]], an open-source software steward must be a legal person (e.g. a company, a foundation, an association) in contrast with a natural person (i.e. a human being). The obligations of open-source software stewards described in [[Article 24]] therefore do not apply to solo maintainers acting in their personal capacity.

However, should a solo maintainer have set up a legal entity (such as a single-member company or foundation) that entity could qualify as an open-source software steward if it meets the other criteria for being a steward.

It is also worth noting that natural persons who monetise their project become subject to the CRA as manufacturers. In that case, they face the same obligations as any other manufacturer under [[Article 13]], not the lighter-touch obligations that apply to open-source software stewards under [[Article 24]]. For more on what qualifies as monetisation, see [[maintainers/monetization]].
