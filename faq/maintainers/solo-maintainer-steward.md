# Can a solo maintainer be considered to be an _open-source software steward_?

No. As defined in [[Article 3(14)]], an _open-source software steward_ must be a _legal person_ (e.g. a company, an organization, etc.) in contrast with a _natural person_ (i.e. a human being). The obligations of _open-source software stewards_ described in [[Article 24]] therefore do not apply to solo maintainers. It is worth noting however, that _natural persons_ are subject to the same obligations as _legal persons_ would be should they monetise their poject.
