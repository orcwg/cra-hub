# I thought the CRA would be focussed on broad horizontal standards? What are these vertical standards for?

The CRA classified types of digital products based on the risk they pose. For higher risk Class I and II products, to achieve a presumption of conformity through compliance with standards, **manufacturers must also comply with the relevant vertical standards**, as per Articles [7](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj/eng#art_7) and [32](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj/eng#art_32) of the Cyber Resilience Act.

A list of Class I and II products can be found in [Annex III of the CRA](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32024R2847#anx_III). You can find a list of requested vertical standards the European Commission have requested in Annex I of the [CRA Standardisation Request](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/enorm/mandate/606_en).
