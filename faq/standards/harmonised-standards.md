# What is a _harmonised standard_ and why does it matter?

A _harmonised standard_ is a standard adopted by one of the [European Standardisation Organisations (ESOs)][ESO].
Certain (but not all) _harmonised standards_ are referenced in the [_Official Journal of the European Union_][OJEU] by the European Commission.
Harmonised standards referenced in this way provide products that conform with them a _presumption of conformity_ with the requirements covered by those standards.
Harmonised standards may be referenced with restrictions, in which case they only provide partial _presumption of conformity_.
The _presumption of conformity_ provided by harmonised standards referenced in the _Official Journal of the European Union_ is why it is expected that most organisations will choose to implement such standards when they exist, to comply with the CRA.

However, not all harmonised standards are referenced.
Those that are not referenced are often foundational standards upon which other standards build. In general, only the vertical (product-specific) standards are referenced, though sometimes horizontal standards that cover generic requirements may be referenced with restrictions.

The ORC WG maintains a [list of _harmonised standards_][standards] requested by the European Commission to the ESOs.
