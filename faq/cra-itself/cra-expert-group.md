# What is the CRA Expert Group?

The CRA Expert Group is a consultative body set up by the European Commission to provide it with advice and expertise during the implementation of the CRA. It is composed of 60 members which include:

- individual experts appointed in their personal capacities,
- industry representatives,
- trade and business associations,
- NGOs,
- member state authorities (plus the Norwegian Communications Authority), and
- ENISA.

Open source is particularly well represented, as the following open source organizations are members:

- the Apache Software Foundation,
- the Eclipse Foundation,
- OpenSSF, and
- the Sovereign Tech Agency.

As described in [[Article 9]], the CRA Expert Group is consulted by the European Commission as it:

- prepares Guidance as described in [[Article 26]],
- prepares the technical descriptions of the important and critical product categories described in [[Article 7]] and [[Article 8]], and listed in [[Annex III]] and [[Annex IV]] respectively, and
- undertakes preparatory work for the evaluation and review of the CRA.

In practice, the CRA Expert Group meets in plenary sessions 2-3 times a year. It has multiple work strands on specific topics, including one on open source, which meet on an _ad-hoc_ basis. The agenda and minutes of the plenary sessions are public and are available on the [CRA Expert Group's offical page][official page]. Draft regulation and guidance shared with the CRA Expert Group may not be shared publicly until it is officially published.
