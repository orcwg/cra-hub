# What is the 'CE mark' and do I need to add it to my software?

The CE mark is a distinctive symbol indicating that a product complies with the relevant EU product regulations. **Under the CRA, only manufacturers are authorized to add the CE mark to a product.** Open source software stewards and developers outside the scope of the CRA cannot do so.

[[Article 30]] of the CRA outlines how manufactures need to add the CE mark to the their product.

For hardware, the CE mark must be placed directly on the product. If this is not possible, it must be placed on the packaging and in the EU declaration of conformity.

For software, the CE mark must appear either in the EU declaration of conformity or on a website accompanying the software product, provided it is easily accessible to consumers.

Failure to properly add the CE mark may result in financial penalties.
