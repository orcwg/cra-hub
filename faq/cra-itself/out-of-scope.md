# What kinds of products are NOT regulated by the CRA?

The following are NOT regulated by the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA):

- Services
- Software as a service (SaaS) (already regulated by NIS 2 (Directive (EU) 2022/2555) and/or DORA (Regulation (EU)
2022/2554)) and websites, unless used to process data for a product that is regulated by the CRA (see [[remote-processing]])
- Products that do not contain software
- Products already covered by other regulations or directives: civil aviation equipment (already covered by Regulation (EU) 2018/1139), marine equipment (already covered by Directive (EU) 2014/90), medical devices (already covered by Regulation (EU) 2017/745 and Regulation (EU) 2017/746), and motor vehicles (already covered by Regulation (EU) 2019/2144)
- Products exclusively designed for national security or defence purposes
- Products specifically designed to process classified information

_It is worth noting however, that the intent of the EU legislators is to harmonize the various regulations mentioned above with the CRA in the near future._
