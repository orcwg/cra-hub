# What kinds of products are NOT regulated by the CRA?

The following are NOT regulated by the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA):

- Services
- Software as a service (SaaS) (already regulated by [NIS 2][] and/or [DORA][])
- Products that do not contain software
- Products already covered by other regulations or directives: civil aviation equipment (already covered by [2018/1139][]), marine equipment (already covered by [2014/90][]), medical devices (already covered by [2017/745][] and [2017/746][]), and motor vehicles (already covered by [2019/2144][])

_It is worth noting however, that the intent of the EU legislators is to harmonize the various regulations mentioned above with the CRA in the near future._
