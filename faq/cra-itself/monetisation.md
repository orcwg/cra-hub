# What does 'intention to monetise' mean under the CRA?

Under the CRA, 'intention to monetise' refers to the goal of generating revenue from a product, even when the product itself is provided free of charge. This concept helps determine whether software is being supplied in the course of a commercial activity.

[[Recital 15]] provides several examples of monetisation that go beyond directly charging for a product:

- **Monetising related services**: Providing a software platform through which the manufacturer monetises other services
- **Monetising user data**: Requiring the processing of personal data as a condition for use, for reasons other than exclusively improving the security, compatibility, or interoperability of the software
- **Monetising support**: Charging for technical support services beyond the recuperation of actual costs
- **Excessive donations**: Accepting donations beyond the recuperation of actual costs

The key distinction is whether revenue generation is a purpose of making the software available, rather than simply a means of covering legitimate development and maintenance costs.
