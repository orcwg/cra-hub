* What support do you need (can you imagine) to voluntarily fulfil the requirements of the CRA in your project (support towards the manufacturers)?

* What specifications (guidance/standards) would you need for voluntary support?

* Are there any support services that you already receive and if so, what are they?

* From whom do you receive this support?

* Could this support help with CRA implementation?

## Questions for potential stewards

* What do you think will make you a steward?

* What do you need from the open source developers?

* What do you need to prove to the manufacturers that the open source components fulfil the requirements?

* In the event that there is an attestation for open source components, is there a willingness to receive money for them (from the manufacturers) and/or to pay for them (to developers)?

* Are there any requirements that you fear you will not be able to fulfil as a steward?
