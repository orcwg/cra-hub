# Questions to OSS projects

About your project(s)
* How many people contribute (code, docs, any non-financial contributions) to your project?

* What kind of project are you responding about?
* (multiple choice: end user application, business application, infrastructure application, utility or tool, component library used by applications...) I know these are not great categories, but I suspect some kind of categorization wold be useful

* What is your role on the project?
* (multiple choice: Founder/project owner, committer, contributor, business or management lead, other)

* How is your project funded currently?
(Multiple choice options (check multiple): no organized funding, solicit donations, take $ for sponsored features, offer paid technical support, offer premium features, contributors time is funded by their employers, other)

* What do you believe your role will be under the CRA?
* (Multiple choice options: Manufacturer, steward, oss maintainer, other, don't know)

* Why do you think you will be subject to the CRA?
* (Multiple choice options:    )

* What guidance/standards would you need for voluntary compliance with the CRA requirements?
* (open-ended, free text)

* What help do you need most (from steward, manufacturer, regulators/authorities, sponsor companies, vulnerability program leaders, etc.) as a maintainer to make your project more attractive for your users, as they eventually may see CRA compliance as an adoption requirement?
* (open-ended, free text)
  
* Are there any support services that you are already receiving and if so, what are they?
* (it is not very clear what this is about, perhaps some examples of what is meant would help?)

* Who do you receive this support from?

* Could this support already help you fulfil the CRA requirements?

* Do you want to be able to declare/respond that you as a contributor or individual maintainer are out of scope for CRA obligations?
* (yes/no question)

* Can you imagine someone taking on the steward role for your project?
* (yes/no question)

* Can you imagine taking on the steward role yourself?
* (yes/no question)

* Who can you imagine as a steward for your project?
* (?? are we asking them to identify a foundation or organization?)

* Could it be more than one steward?

## Questions for potential stewards

* What do you think makes you a steward?

* What do you need from the open source developers to fulfil the CRA requirements?

* What help do you  also need (from manufacturer,  regulators/authorities, sponsor companies, vulnerability program leaders, etc.) to fulfil CRA requirements?

* What do you need to prove to the manufacturers that the open source components fulfil the requirements?

* In the event that there is proof that an open source component fulfils the CRA requirements, is there a willingness to receive money for this as a steward (from the manufacturers) or to pay for it (to developers)?

* Are there any requirements that you fear you will not be able to fulfil as a steward?

* Are you afraid of any consequences if you as a steward don't meet CRA obligations?

* What would you consider if somebody asks you to become a steward?
