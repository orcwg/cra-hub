# Questions to OSS projects

* What questions regarding the commercial background arise for your project?

* Do you know what your role will be under the CRA?

* Is there anything that makes you feel that you have to fulfil the requirements of the CRA?

* What guidance/standards would you need for voluntary compliance with the CRA requirements?

* What help do you need most (from steward, manufacturer, regulators/authorities, sponsor companies, vulnerability program leaders, etc.) as a maintainer to make your project more attractive for your users, as they eventually may see CRA compliance as an adoption requirement?

* Are there any support services that you are already receiving and if so, what are they?

* Who do you receive this support from?

* Could this support already help you fulfil the CRA requirements?

* Do you want to be able to declare/respond that you as a contributor or individual maintainer are out of scope for CRA obligations? (yes/no question)

* Can you imagine someone taking on the steward role for your project?

* Can you imagine taking on the steward role yourself?

* Who can you imagine as a steward for your project?

* Could it be more than one steward?

## Questions for potential stewards

* What do you think makes you a steward?

* What do you need from the open source developers to fulfil the CRA requirements?

* What help do you  also need (from manufacturer,  regulators/authorities, sponsor companies, vulnerability program leaders, etc.) to fulfil CRA requirements?

* What do you need to prove to the manufacturers that the open source components fulfil the requirements?

* In the event that there is proof that an open source component fulfils the CRA requirements, is there a willingness to receive money for this as a steward (from the manufacturers) or to pay for it (to developers)?

* Are there any requirements that you fear you will not be able to fulfil as a steward?

* Are you afraid of any consequences if you as a steward don't meet CRA obligations?

* What would you consider if somebody asks you to become a steward?
