## Questions for manufacturers in terms of the CRA:

* What risks do you see when using open source components in your products (security risks / business risks / other risks)?

* Can it be ensured that the requirements of the CRA are met for the integrated open source components from the manufacturers own resources?

* How do you deal with open source components that you do not know whether they fulfil the requirements of the CRA?
  Response options: e.g. I ignore the project, I contact the project/developer, I help the project/invest in the project etc. as well as an ‘Other’ field with a free text field)

* Do you see requirements of the CRA for which it is difficult to ensure that the open source components integrated in the product fulfil them? If so, which ones and why?

* What support, and from whom, is needed to ensure that open source components in your products fulfil the CRA requirements?

* Would proof that open source components fulfil the CRA requirements help?

* In the event that there is proof of fulfilment of the CRA requirements for open source components, is there a willingness to pay for them?

* From the manufacturer's point of view, what can cooperation with open source look like (especially with the stewards)?
  * What agreements should be made?

* From the manufacturer's point of view, is legal advice required for collaboration with stewards / open source projects?

* Are you already working with potential stewards?

* Do you support them or are you planning to support them?
  * If so, how does this support look like?

* Do you know who develops the open source components that you use in your products?

* Do you work with the providers of open source components that you know?

* Do you plan to fork/maintain open source projects because of the CRA?

* Are you planning to replace open source projects with proprietary software because of the CRA?

* Are you already performing due diligence and risk assessment for open source components you use in your products?

* Are you already following regulations or standards? 
  * If yes which one?

* Do you have a backup plan (what plan?) if some of the critical open source projects you rely on will be abandoned by maintainers?
