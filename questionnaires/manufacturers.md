Questions for manufacturers in terms of the CRA:

- What risks do you see for the use of open source components in your products?

- Can you ensure from your own resources that the requirements of the CRA are met for the integrated open source components?

- How do you deal with open source components that you classify as non conformant to the CRA?

- For which of the requirements is it difficult to ensure conformity?

- What support is needed?

- What assurances are needed?

- Is a legal assessment needed?

- In the event that there are attestations for open source components, is there a willingness to pay for them?

- From a manufacturer's point of view, what can a co-operation with open source look like (especially with the stewards) - What agreements should be made?

- Are you already working with potential stewards?

- Do you support them or are you planning to support them?

- Do you know the providers of the open source components that you use in your products?

- Do you work with the providers of open source components that you are familiar with?

- Are you planning to fork open source projects because of the CRA?

- Do you plan to replace open source projects with proprietary software because of the CRA?


Questions for potential stewards:

- What do you think will make you a steward?

- What do you need from the open source developers?

- What do you need to prove to the manufacturers that the open source components fulfil the requirements?

- In the event that there is an attestation for open source components, is there a willingness to receive money for them (from the manufacturers) and/or to pay for them (to developers)?

- Are there any requirements that you fear you will not be able to fulfil as a steward?
