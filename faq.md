# CRA FAQ

## Maintainers

#### Q: Am I subject to the CRA if I only contribute to an open source project?

No. Contributions to an open source project are explicitely not in scope of the CRA. See [Recital 18][]: 

> This Regulation does not apply to natural or legal persons who contribute with source code to products with digital elements qualifying as free and open-source software that are not under their responsibility.

## Open-Source Software Stewards

#### Q: What is an _open-source software steward_?

_Open-source software steward_ is a term defined in [Article 3(14)][] of the CRA. It describes an organization which supports open source software but isn't itself a commercial actor (e.g. an open source foundation):

> ‘open-source software steward’ means a legal person, other than a manufacturer, that has the purpose or objective of systematically providing support on a sustained basis for the development of specific products with digital elements, qualifying as free and open-source software and intended for commercial activities, and that ensures the viability of those products;

#### Q: Can an solo maintainer be considered to be an _open-source software steward_?

#### Q: Can a loosely organized group of maintainers be considered to be an _open-source software steward_?

In [Article 3(14)][], the CRA defines _open-source software steward_ as a "legal person, other than a manufacturer." In European regulation, groups of people acting in concert are generally seen as a legal person, whether or not they have formalized their relationship by creating a society, trust, foundation, or company. So in general, it is fair to assume that a group of open source developers maintaining an open source project together will be considered to be an _open-source software steward_, even if it is only loosely organized together.
