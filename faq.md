# CRA FAQ

## Maintainers

#### Q: Am I subject to the CRA if I only contribute to an open source project?

No. Contributions to an open source project are explicitely not in scope of the CRA. See [Recital 18][]: 

> This Regulation does not apply to natural or legal persons who contribute with source code to products with digital elements qualifying as free and open-source software that are not under their responsibility.

## Open-Source Software Stewards

#### Q: What is an _open-source software steward_?

_Open-source software steward_ is a term defined in [Article 3(14)][] of the CRA. It describes an organization which supports open source software but isn't itself a commercial actor (e.g. an open source foundation):

> ‘open-source software steward’ means a legal person, other than a manufacturer, that has the purpose or objective of systematically providing support on a sustained basis for the development of specific products with digital elements, qualifying as free and open-source software and intended for commercial activities, and that ensures the viability of those products;

_Open-source software steward_ are subject to a "light-touch and tailor-made regulatory regime" ([Recital 19][]), defined in [Article 24][].

#### Q: Can an solo maintainer be considered to be an _open-source software steward_?

No. As defined in [Article 3(14)][], an _open-source software steward_ must be a _legal person_ (e.g. a company, an organization, etc.) in contrast with a _natural person_ (i.e. a human being). The obligations of _open-source software stewards_ described in [Article 24][] therefore do not apply to solo maintainers. It is worth noting however, that _natural persons_ are subject to the same obligations as _legal persons_ would be should they monetize their poject.

#### Q: Can a loosely organized group of maintainers be considered to be an _open-source software steward_?

In [Article 3(14)][], the CRA defines _open-source software steward_ as a "legal person, other than a manufacturer." In European regulation, groups of people acting in concert can be considered as a legal person, whether or not they have formalized their relationship by creating a society, trust, foundation, or company. So it is possible to that in some cases, a group of open source developers maintaining an open source project together might be considered to be an _open-source software steward_, even if it is only loosely organized together.

## Manufacturers

#### Q: What is a _manufacturer_?

The term _Manufacturer_ is defined in [Article 3(13)][] of the CRA:
	
> ‘manufacturer’ means a natural or legal person who develops or manufactures products with digital elements or has products with digital elements designed, developed or manufactured, and markets them under its name or trademark, whether for payment, monetisation or free of charge;

#### Q: Can a _manufacturer_ also be an _open-source software steward_?

Yes, a _manufacturer_ can also be an _open-source software steward_, but it cannot be both the _manufacturer_ and _open-source software steward_ of the same project.
