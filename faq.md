# CRA FAQ

## Maintainers

#### Q: Am I subject to the CRA if I only contribute to an open source project?

_Open-source software steward_ is a term defined in [Article 3(14)][] of the CRA. It describes an organization which supports open source software but isn't itself a commercial actor (e.g. an open source foundation):

> ‘open-source software steward’ means a legal person, other than a manufacturer, that has the purpose or objective of systematically providing support on a sustained basis for the development of specific products with digital elements, qualifying as free and open-source software and intended for commercial activities, and that ensures the viability of those products;
