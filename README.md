# CRA Hub
Everything you ever wanted to know about the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and its implementation. This hub is maintained by the [Open Regulatory Compliance](https://github.com/orcwg/orcwg) (ORC) Working Group, a neutral forum for the open source community and the broader software industry to facilitate compliance with the CRA.

## How to Contribute

ORC has mobilised a dedicated community effort to support open source stakeholders. Recognising the unique challenges faced by developers, maintainers, and organisations, we are collaboratively developing a suite of resources designed to demystify the CRA and provide actionable guidance. Our key initiatives, each crafted through community input, empower stakeholders to achieve informed and effective compliance.

Everyone is welcome to contribute. Learn more about how the working group is governed and maintained by visiting the main [ORC WG page](https://github.com/orcwg/orcwg).

To contribute:
1. Create an [Eclipse Foundation account](https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/register) which includes a [Contributor Agreement](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eca/) (as is common with all open source contributions).
2. Consider joining the [mailing list](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/open-regulatory-compliance) and [SIG calls](https://github.com/orcwg/orcwg/blob/main/MEETINGS.md#cyber-resilience-sig-call) to get up to speed.
