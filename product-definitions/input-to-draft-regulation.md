      <td>Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 lays down rules on the cybersecurity of products with digital elements. In particular, Article 7(2) of that Regulation sets out categories of important products with digital elements that are subject to conformity assessment procedures that are stricter than those applicable to other products with digital elements. Article 8(2) of Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 sets out categories of critical products with digital elements for which manufacturers could be required to obtain a European cybersecurity certificate under a European cybersecurity certification scheme pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council or which would be subject to strict conformity assessment procedures.</td>

A product’s core functionality refers to its fundamental features and capabilities that fulfil the primary purpose for which the product with digital elements has been made available on the market and without which the product would not be able to meet its intended purpose or reasonably foreseeable use.</td>

      <td>When developing a product with digital elements, and in order to achieve their desired set of functionalities, manufacturers typically integrate into their own products with digital elements other products with digital elements that can meet the technical description of a category of important or critical products. Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2024/2847, the integration of a product with digital elements which has the core functionality of a product category set out in Annex III and Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 does not in itself render the product in which it is integrated subject to the conformity assessment procedures applicable to those product categories.</td>

      <td>The fact that a product with digital elements performs functions other than or additional to those detailed in the technical descriptions set out in the Annexes does not in itself mean that the product with digital elements does not have the core functionality of a product category set out in the Annexes. For example, products with digital elements that have the core functionality of “operating systems” often include software that performs ancillary functions not included in the technical description of that product category, such as calculators or simple graphics editors. This, however, does not in itself mean that such products with digital elements do not meet the technical description of “operating systems”. On the other hand, a security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) software often has the ability to perform the functions of products with digital elements in the category of “security information and event management (SIEM) systems”, i.e. gather data, analyse it and present it as actionable information for security purposes. However, as its core functionality is to integrate separate security tools, automate low-level tasks and orchestrate security incident responses, SOAR software are generally not to be considered to meet the technical description of “security information and event management (SIEM) systems”.</td>

In accordance with Article 13(2) and (3) of that Regulation, and irrespective of whether the product with digital elements is considered to be an important or critical product with digital elements, manufacturers are to carry out a comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessment and indicate how the essential cybersecurity requirements are implemented as informed by the risk assessment, including their testing and assurance.

        <p>Comment type: editorial</p>
        <p>Recital (5) addresses four core points:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The essential requirements need to be implemented using a risk-based approach</li>
          <li>A comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessment needs to be undertaken and documented</li>
          <li>Both of the above are true irrespective of whether a product fits the technical description of an important or critical product</li>
          <li>Products whose core functionality fit the technical description of an important or critical product need a specific conformity assesment.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These are important and welcomed clarifications. In fact we believe they are so important that they should be broken down into separate recitals.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Recital (5) omits to reference the special regime for free and open source products mentioned in article 32(5) while referencing the other relevant points of that article. Including point (5) when mentioning points (2), (3), and (4) of article 32 will avoid creating uncertainty for stakeholders who might not well understand the interplay between the different parts of the regulation.</p>

        <p>It appears that the description goes beyond <em>centralized administrative control over configuration</em> for large-scale networks (frequency scheduling in mobile networks, optical configuration for cable systems or other network control plane management software) to include a broad range of software that does networking, including scanners and implementations of common, low-level query-response protocols.</p>
        <p> For example, a software implementation of the ARP protocol to map IP addresses to MAC addresses on common LAN networks, because it collects such mappings, thereby collecting information about and by doing so configuring network elements. Is that the intent? Related, perhaps more realistic examples when it comes to standalone products, would include implementations for DHCP, or DNS (respectively to e.g. assign IP addresses and names on a local LAN).</p>
        <p>Are these all intended to be scoped as a "network management system", an "important product" in the context of the CRA? If not, perhaps condsider the proposed change to emphasize the <em>management</em> aspect of the category.</p>
