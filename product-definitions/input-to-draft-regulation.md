In particular, Article 7(2) of that Regulation sets out categories of important products with digital elements that are subject to conformity assessment procedures that are stricter than those applicable to other products with digital elements. Article 8(2) of Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 sets out categories of critical products with digital elements for which manufacturers could be required to obtain a European cybersecurity certificate under a European cybersecurity certification scheme pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council or which would be subject to strict conformity assessment procedures.</td>

A product’s core functionality refers to its fundamental features and capabilities that fulfil the primary purpose for which the product with digital elements has been made available on the market and without which the product would not be able to meet its intended purpose or reasonably foreseeable use.</td>

      <td>When developing a product with digital elements, and in order to achieve their desired set of functionalities, manufacturers typically integrate into their own products with digital elements other products with digital elements that can meet the technical description of a category of important or critical products. Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2024/2847, the integration of a product with digital elements which has the core functionality of a product category set out in Annex III and Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 does not in itself render the product in which it is integrated subject to the conformity assessment procedures applicable to those product categories.</td>

      <td>The fact that a product with digital elements performs functions other than or additional to those detailed in the technical descriptions set out in the Annexes does not in itself mean that the product with digital elements does not have the core functionality of a product category set out in the Annexes. For example, products with digital elements that have the core functionality of “operating systems” often include software that performs ancillary functions not included in the technical description of that product category, such as calculators or simple graphics editors. This, however, does not in itself mean that such products with digital elements do not meet the technical description of “operating systems”. On the other hand, a security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) software often has the ability to perform the functions of products with digital elements in the category of “security information and event management (SIEM) systems”, i.e. gather data, analyse it and present it as actionable information for security purposes. However, as its core functionality is to integrate separate security tools, automate low-level tasks and orchestrate security incident responses, SOAR software are generally not to be considered to meet the technical description of “security information and event management (SIEM) systems”.</td>

      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          Hypervisors are software products with digital elements that mediate access to physical computing resources and enable the execution and management of virtualised workloads, by running directly on a host, on top of an operating system, or on a combination of the two.
        </p>
        <p>
          This category includes but is not limited to type 1 hypervisors, type 2 hypervisors and hybrid hypervisors.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Container runtime systems are software products with digital elements that manage the lifecycle of containers running on a host operating system, allocating resources and providing isolation between each container and the rest of the system, through operating system level or application-level virtualisation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the context of this category of products, a container is a software product that encapsulates one or more software components and its dependencies in a single package, enabling it to run independently and consistently.
        </p>
        <p>
          This category includes but is not limited to low-level container runtimes and high-level container runtimes.

          Intrusion detection systems are products with digital elements used to detect or identify that an intrusion has been attempted, is occurring, or has occurred on a connected network or system.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Intrusion prevention systems are products with digital elements composed of an intrusion detection system that is designed to actively respond to an intrusion to a connected network or system, typically by blocking suspicious traffic.
