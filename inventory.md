# Inventory of resources relevant to the horizontal CRA standards, Open Source Steward obligations, and voluntary attestation program

The goal of this document is to collect resources that are relevant to the CRA obligations of _open-source software stewards_ and _manufacturers_ when it comes to the development and usage of open source.

_Please add all relevant resources as a table row under the relevant section or subsection._

> [!Note]
> Additional resources are currently collected in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y36Vueb3Eo_djOuRdpyzoCS1vzGaKpjP-99g3J6rw7Y/edit?gid=0#gid=0) and will be folded into this document shortly.
