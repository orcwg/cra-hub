## CRA FAQ
### üìö Read the FAQ
Start by reviewing the current CRA FAQ to understand the scope of existing knowledge.

### ‚ùì Do You Have a Question?
1. Before posting a new question, please check that there is no other in the consolidated answers or the issues that covers it.
2. If your question is already covered - contribute to the open discussion with your vision. (if you can add references, that is super-helpful)
3. If your question is opening a new topic - please follow this guidelines:
   -  **Be as specific as possible** - The FAQ is targeting specific cases, we are trying to avoid open discussions in this forum.
   -  **Identify the stakeholders involved in the question** - Add stewards, maintainers, manufacturers, regulators... that will help also in the process of refinement and in case we get community consensus, include it in the FAQ release (check here the [maturity level for the FAQs](https://github.com/orcwg/cra-hub/blob/main/faq.md#annex-1---maturity-level-process).

### üí¨Contributing to existing discussions
Each FAQ is open to receiving the opinions and views of everyone in the community. Nevertheless, there are certain recommendations for keeping the conversations productive:
1. Be respectful to the other members of the community. Discrepancy is fine, and the main objective of the FAQ is to gain consensus; if it is not reached, it is also fine and doesn't mean that your question is not relevant.
2. Support your opinions with facts or examples. We know that sometimes it may be difficult because there is a lot of interpretation in it, but landing the conversation in tangible terms helps all.
