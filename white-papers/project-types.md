# White paper on types of open source projects

## Abstract

The open source ecosystem is a rich ecosystem composed of very different types of projects and of communities, organizations, and maintainers supporting them. This diversity of project and community types isn't well documented and is rarely considered by policymakers. As a result, the whole open source ecosystem is often lumped together as a whole, or separated into arbitrary groups that don't match reality. The purpose of this white paper is threefold:

1. Identify important traits of open source projects that help differentiate and categorize projects into meaningful groups.
2. Define a set of categories based on those traits.
3. Propose a mapping from identified traits and categories to CRA roles (_Manufacturer_, _Open Source Software Steward_, not in scope).
4. Provide examples of open source projects for each category and demonstrate where they fit and why.

## 1. Differentiating traits of open source project

While open source projects share a number of critical traits such as license recognized by the Open Source Initiative, there's a number of traits that differentiate them.

These traits provide a usefull framework to categorize open source projects together.

Traits:

- governance
- trademark ownership
- contribution model
- business model
- etc.

## 2. Open source project categories

Projects which share certain traits naturally fall in the same category. We've regrouped them in the following categories.


## 3. CRA Mapping

This section proposes from the traits and categories identified in section 2 ann 3 respectively to CRA roles (_Manufacturer_, _Open Source Software Steward_, not in scope).

## 4. Case studies

Using the framework described in section 1 and the mapping described in section to 3, provide a few case studies.
