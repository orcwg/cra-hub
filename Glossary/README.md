üìñ A community-driven glossary to clarify key terms at the intersection of **open source software** and the **EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)**.

## üéØ Purpose

The Cyber Resilience Act introduces new obligations for products with digital elements. Because **open source is present in ~75% of software code worldwide**, aligning terminology between the CRA, standards bodies, and open source communities is critical.  

This glossary aims to:
- **Clarify** how open source terminology is used in the context of the CRA.  
- **Complement** existing resources such as the official CRA FAQ (not replace them).  
- **Support** standards development and policy work with consistent language.  
- **Provide** developers, policymakers, and organisations with a shared reference.
