## Open source software
It is software that anyone can use, modify, and share freely, under a license that guarantees these freedoms without discrimination. More precisely 10 elements are included in the open source definition (OSD)
1. Free redistribution – The license must allow anyone to give away or sell the software as part of a larger distribution without royalties.
2. Source code availability – The program must include source code, or make it freely obtainable.
3. Derived works – Modifications and derived works must be allowed, and must be distributable under the same license.
4. Integrity of the author’s source code – The license may require modifications to be distributed as patches, but must allow building modified versions.
5. No discrimination against persons or groups.
6. No discrimination against fields of endeavour – e.g. no restrictions on commercial use.
7. Distribution of license – The rights must apply to everyone to whom the program is redistributed, without the need for additional licenses.
8. License must not be specific to a product – Rights apply even if the software is extracted from a particular distribution.
9. License must not restrict other software – The license must not place restrictions on other software distributed with it.
10. License must be technology-neutral – It must not be predicated on a particular technology or interface.

## Open source project
An open source project is a collaborative effort to develop software that is distributed under an OSI-approved license, ensuring compliance with the Open Source Definition ([OSD](https://opensource.org/osd))
. This means the project’s code can be used, modified, and redistributed by anyone, without discrimination, and under conditions that preserve these freedoms.

Beyond the license, an open source project typically:
- Provides public access to source code.
- Welcomes contributions from individuals and organisations.
- Operates with transparent governance, so decisions about the project are made openly.
- Builds a community of users and contributors around shared goals.


## Third-party component
A third-party component is any piece of software (library, framework, tool, or module) that an open source project did not develop itself, but instead reuses or integrates from an external source offered under an open source license.
Third-party components are characterised by:
- External origin: The component comes from outside the project’s own codebase.
- Open source licensing: It uses an OSI-approved license.
- Dependencies: Third-party components become part of the project’s dependency tree.


## Supplier
A supplier is the economic operator who places a product with digital elements on the EU market, who bears the legal responsibility for ensuring the product complies with all cybersecurity and conformity requirements.

## Software supply chain
The software supply chain is the entire sequence of code, dependencies, tools, infrastructure, and processes that are involved in creating, maintaining, distributing, and consuming open source software.


## Open source maintainer
An open source maintainer is an individual or a group responsible for overseeing the development, quality, and governance of an open source project. Maintainers ensure that the project continues to comply with an OSI-approved license and the Open Source Definition, while guiding contributions and coordinating the community.

## Open source developer (contributor)
An open source developer is an individual who contributes code, documentation, or other improvements to an open source project. Developers help evolve the project by implementing features, fixing bugs, and collaborating with the community while respecting the project’s governance and the terms of its OSI-approved license.
